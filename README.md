# 👋 Hi, I'm Uriel Lopez

I'm a Business Intelligence and Data Analyst with hands-on experience using SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI to turn data into actionable insights. My foundation in data analytics is strengthened by a strong background in business operations, customer engagement, and marketing strategy.

Before diving into analytics, I worked in finance, operations, and e-commerce — managing teams, driving sales, and improving processes. I now combine those experiences with technical skills to help companies make better, faster, data-driven decisions.

## 🎵 Fun Fact

Outside of work, I’m a music lover, runner, and Star Wars fan. I enjoy spending time outdoors with my family, going on hikes, and hanging out with my two dogs — Obi and Chewy (yes, named after *those* guys). When I’m not analyzing data, you’ll probably catch me enjoying time with my son or discovering new sounds on guitar.
